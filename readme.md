**Dependencies**
##
C++ 11 and above

No specific third party repositories

##
**Usage**
##

Include the file to your project file folders then use CMake to build it.

###
Specific steps
###
1. Use the *shipCourse* class to generate the course for each ship
2. Generate a global water surface grid using *surfaceGrid* class
3. Update each ship course at each time stamp using 
```
shipCourse::expand()
```
Every ship position is in the frame of your generated surface gird.

4. Output wake data to surface grid using 
```
shipCourse::outputDataToGrid(surfaceGrid)
```
Every point (x,y) is in the frame of your generated surface gird.

5. Store wake data to .csv file
```
surfaceGrid::outputData(filename)
```
6. Get wake elevation at point (x, y) in the world call
```
shipCourse::getElevation(x,y)
```
If there are multiple ships, you should itter all the ship courses. 
Every point (x,y) is in the frame of your generated surface gird.

##
**Running the example**
##

We provide an example *KW_example* for you to run. 

###
Steps:
###
1. Build the porject using CMake
 ```
 $ cmake .
 $ make
 ```
 2. Run the example 
  ```
 $ ./KW_example
 ```
 3. For comparison, we provide a *calculated_example* using equation (1) in the paper.
   ```
 $ ./calculated_example
 ```
 4. The generated wake data will be store in .csv files. Use Matlab script to visualize the results. We provide the visualization scripts in the script folder. You should specify the .csv file name in the script.
